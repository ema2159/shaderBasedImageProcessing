This project implements several image processing algorithms using GLSL. Such algorithms are displayed in a series of 3D scenes rendered in the web browser using Three.js.

The algorithms implemented are the following:
- Hue shift transformation
- 2D kernel Gaussian filter
- Laplace filter
- Combined Laplace and Gaussian filters 
- Image arithmetic
- Image scaling
- Median filter
- Separable Gaussian filter

The scenes in question have a GUI that allows to control the different parameters of the implemented algorithms. The scene in question looks as follows:

The algorithms can be checked [[https://ema2159.github.io/shaderBasedImageProcessing/Exercise2/index.html][here]].
